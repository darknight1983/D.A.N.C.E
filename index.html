									This weekend is about YOU! I see you working hard. I see you raising your kids (even the grown ones); I see you counseling, giving, serving, loving unconditionally, and going above and beyond the call of duty in everything you put your hands to. But when will you give that same energy to YOU? Not just keeping your nails done and going to the spa, but really investing in the woman you see yourself being and attracting the things you really want! This is an inside job and IT IS TIME  to clock in.
								</p><br/>
								<p>
									You have to admit that the time, money, energy and resources you so generously share with your loved ones makes you happy, but I know that it is oftentimes a thankless task that can leave you drained, underappreciated, and providing you little to none of the acknowledgement YOU truly desire and deserve.

								<p>
									This is not just another heels class where you’ll learn tricky choreography and
									stunt on the gram, rather it is an opportunity to explore and discover the
									limitations and possibilities of your body and how it wants to authentically express
									itself. It is an opportunity to reconnect with the wildest parts of yourself that
									you’ve let grow cold. It is the opportunity you have been waiting on to trust
									yourself, take a risk & decide to play full out!

								<h2>DECIDE To Put You First!</h2>
								<p>
									It is interesting that we can without a second thought give our last to our loved ones and to jobs we hate, yet hesitate when the opportunity presents itself for you to #LEVELUP (speaking from countless experiences)! You pray, meditate, and wait for other people to approve your dreams. You analyze and procrastinate until you’ve talked yourself into a fearful oblivion and you’re again stagnant hoping for the change you decided not to create for yourself.
									It will always be a risk and you will never fully be ready for the next level but you are enough NOW! You cannot fear the ridicule of other people’s opinion who have grown used to you putting yourself last- you are NOT Her anymore!

								</p>
								<p>
									You were brought to this page for such a time as this so there is no need to sell you on what you know to be true for you. The best bet you can make is on yourself- you have nothing to lose and life to gain.
